Hey there! Here's a bunch of stuff that needs done:

## TODO

- [ ] Cargoify 'em all.
    Note: libredox, common, and graphics makes use of cargo. However, **they do not compile using cargo**. This is because they depends on non-cargo crates, which is quite a pain. What we want is to throw GNU make out of the window and use cargo instead.

- [ ] Expand the common module with new methods. Look at std for inspiration.

- [ ] Make Ox install stuff.

- [ ] Add a DNS system.

- [ ] ZFS (WIP)

- [ ] Documentation: Lots of docs are needed. Libredox and common are documented. The rest is almost.... non-documented.

- [ ] Port toml-rs to redox

- [ ] Add the multithreading functionality that the std provides.


Add more stuff if you want.
