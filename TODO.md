Hey there! Here's a bunch of stuff that needs done:

- [ ] Cargoify 'em all.
    Note: libredox, common, and graphics makes use of cargo. However, **they do not compile using cargo**. This is because they depends on non-cargo crates, which is quite a pain. What we want is to throw GNU make out of the window and use cargo instead.

- [ ] Expand the common module with new methods. Look at std for inspiration.

- [ ] Make Ox install stuff.

- [ ] Add a DNS system.

- [ ] ZFS (WIP)


Add more stuff if you want.
