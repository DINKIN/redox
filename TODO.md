Hey there! Here's a bunch of stuff that needs done:

## TODO

- [ ] Cargoify 'em all.
      On the progress: All the crates are now cargoified and are using the cargo
      file structure, however they do not compile using cargo. So the task is
      not complete. What is needed is linking the crates.

- [ ] Expand the common module with new methods. Look at std for inspiration.

- [ ] Make Ox install stuff.

- [ ] Add a DNS system.

- [ ] ZFS (WIP)

- [ ] Documentation: Lots of docs are needed. Libredox and common are documented.
      It's all documented however it's not well documented. Many of the docs are
      extremely short and poorly explain.

- [ ] Port toml-rs to redox

- [ ] Add the multithreading functionality that the std provides.

- [ ] Remove the uses of `return` statements.


Add more stuff if you want.
