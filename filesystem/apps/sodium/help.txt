Sodium: A modern editor for the Redox OS
========================================

Sodium is a editor inspired by a various
console based, keyboard-centric editor.
The keybindings are loosly based on Vim.

This is a small guide for using Sodium.

Sodium consists of three different types
of command sets.

1) Global commands. These are possible to
   use anywhere, in any mode.
2) Mode-specific commands. These are
   specific to a given mode.
3) Namespaces. Commands that can be
   invoked as input (after) certain
   commands.

The modes are of two types:
- Command mode: In command mode a command
  can be preceeded by a numeral. This
  numeral is called a parameter, and can
  mean various things for the command.
- Primitive mode: In this type of mode
  the keys are given directly to the
  handler without any form of parsing.

Global commands
---------------

- [alt][space]: Go to the next cursor.
- [alt]<motion>: Move a given motion.
- [shift][space]: Go back to normal mode.

Modes
-----

# Normal

This is the default mode. Normal mode
provides various commands. Normal mode

change modes.
